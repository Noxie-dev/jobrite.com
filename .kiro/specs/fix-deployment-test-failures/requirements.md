# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The JobRite application is experiencing a 500 server error on the live site due to deployment failures caused by critical test failures in the MoneyRite tax calculation system. The deployment process includes a comprehensive test suite that must pass before deployment, and currently 5 tests are failing with critical calculation accuracy issues that prevent successful deployment.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all critical tax calculation tests to pass, so that the application can be deployed successfully to production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the golden test vectors run THEN the medical credit calculation SHALL return the correct monthly amount (R60.67 for 2 members, not R728.00)
2. WHEN salary breakdown calculations are performed THEN the result SHALL include all required fields including 'taxable_monthly'
3. WHEN invalid inputs are provided to tax calculations THEN the system SHALL raise appropriate validation exceptions
4. WHEN error scenarios are tested THEN the system SHALL handle invalid inputs gracefully without crashing

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the pay rate conversion calculations to be mathematically consistent, so that users get accurate salary conversions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN converting hourly rates to annual via monthly THEN the result SHALL be within R5.00 of direct hourly-to-annual conversion
2. WHEN performing pay rate conversions THEN the mathematical precision SHALL be maintained across all conversion paths
3. WHEN rounding occurs in conversions THEN it SHALL be consistent and predictable

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper input validation and error handling, so that the system is robust and secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN negative values are provided as input THEN the system SHALL raise ValueError
2. WHEN invalid string inputs are provided THEN the system SHALL raise InvalidOperation or ValueError
3. WHEN None values are provided THEN the system SHALL raise TypeError
4. WHEN boundary conditions are tested THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the deployment process to succeed, so that users can access the live application without 500 errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN all tests pass THEN the deployment process SHALL complete successfully
2. WHEN the application is deployed THEN it SHALL be accessible without 500 server errors
3. WHEN users access the live site THEN they SHALL see the proper JobRite interface
4. WHEN the deployment completes THEN all static files SHALL be served correctly

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all required dependencies to be properly declared, so that the deployment process can install all necessary packages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the requirements.txt is processed THEN all imported Django apps SHALL have their corresponding packages listed
2. WHEN social_django is imported in settings THEN django-social-auth or social-auth-app-django SHALL be in requirements.txt
3. WHEN the build process runs THEN no ModuleNotFoundError SHALL occur for configured Django apps
4. WHEN dependencies are installed THEN the application SHALL start without import errors
