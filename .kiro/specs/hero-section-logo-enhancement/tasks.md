  - Implement logo fade-in animation that matches existing hero animations
  - Ensure logo maintains aspect ratio across all screen sizes
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 1.5, 5.3_

- [ ] 4. Enhance particle animation configuration
  - Update JavaScript particle creation with slower, more natural speed settings
  - Reduce particle opacity values for softer visual appearance
  - Implement randomized drift calculation with natural variation patterns
  - Add particle lifecycle management with proper cleanup mechanisms
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.5_

- [ ] 5. Implement gentle pulsing flash effect for particles
  - Create CSS keyframes for gentle pulsing animation with subtle scaling
  - Add JavaScript timer system to trigger random pulsing on particles
  - Implement pulsing effect with configurable interval and duration
  - Ensure pulsing effect respects user motion preferences for accessibility
  - _Requirements: 2.4, 5.4_

- [ ] 6. Enhance mouse interaction system for particles
  - Increase mouse interaction radius for better user feedback
  - Implement smooth scaling and color transitions during mouse attraction
  - Add enhanced particle tracking with improved distance calculations
  - Create throttled mouse event handling for optimal performance
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.5_

- [ ] 7. Implement performance optimizations and fallbacks
  - Add device performance detection to adjust particle count dynamically
  - Implement graceful degradation for browsers without animation support
  - Create CSS-only fallback animations for reduced motion preferences
  - Add memory leak prevention with proper particle cleanup intervals
  - _Requirements: 2.5, 4.5, 5.4_

- [ ] 8. Update particle animation CSS with enhanced effects
  - Modify existing particle CSS classes with new opacity and timing values
  - Add mouse-attracted state styling with enhanced visual feedback
  - Implement pulsing animation keyframes with subtle glow effects
  - Create responsive particle sizing for different screen sizes
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 3.2, 5.1_

- [ ] 9. Test and validate hero section enhancements
  - Write unit tests for particle animation functions and lifecycle management
  - Test logo display and fallback functionality across different browsers
  - Validate responsive behavior on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices
  - Verify accessibility compliance with screen readers and motion preferences
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 2.5, 3.4, 5.5_

- [ ] 10. Integrate and finalize hero section improvements
  - Ensure logo and enhanced particles work harmoniously with existing design
  - Verify color scheme consistency and professional aesthetic maintenance
  - Test overall performance impact and optimize if necessary
  - Validate that enhancements improve user experience without disruption
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.5_
