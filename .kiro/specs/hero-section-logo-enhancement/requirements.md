# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the JobRite.com hero section by replacing the current "WorkWise SA" typography with a professional JobRite logo and improving the particle animation system for a more refined, engaging user experience. The enhancement focuses on brand consistency, visual appeal, and interactive responsiveness while maintaining the professional aesthetic of the job portal.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a visitor to JobRite.com, I want to see the JobRite logo prominently displayed in the hero section, so that I can immediately identify the brand and trust the platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the home page THEN the system SHALL display the JobRite logo in place of the current "WorkWise SA" text
2. WHEN the logo is displayed THEN the system SHALL position it centrally in the hero content area with appropriate sizing
3. WHEN the logo loads THEN the system SHALL maintain the existing fade-in animation for brand consistency
4. WHEN viewed on different devices THEN the system SHALL scale the logo appropriately for mobile, tablet, and desktop screens
5. WHEN the logo is implemented THEN the system SHALL use SVG format for optimal scalability and performance

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user interacting with the hero section, I want the particle animations to feel more natural and subtle, so that they enhance rather than distract from the content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN particles are animated THEN the system SHALL move them at a slower, more natural pace compared to the current speed
2. WHEN particles are displayed THEN the system SHALL reduce their opacity to create a softer, more subtle visual effect
3. WHEN particles move THEN the system SHALL include randomized movement patterns with gentle directional changes
4. WHEN particles are visible THEN the system SHALL add a gentle pulsing flash effect that occurs periodically
5. WHEN the animation runs THEN the system SHALL maintain smooth performance across all device types

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user moving my mouse over the hero section, I want enhanced interactive feedback from the particles, so that I feel engaged with the interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user moves their mouse near particles THEN the system SHALL provide more robust attraction effects with increased responsiveness
2. WHEN mouse interaction occurs THEN the system SHALL create a larger interaction radius for better user feedback
3. WHEN particles are attracted to the mouse THEN the system SHALL include smooth scaling and color transitions
4. WHEN multiple particles are in the interaction zone THEN the system SHALL handle simultaneous interactions smoothly
5. WHEN mouse interaction ends THEN the system SHALL return particles to their natural state with smooth transitions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer implementing the logo, I want clear guidance on logo placement and format requirements, so that I can ensure optimal display quality and performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the logo THEN the system SHALL place the logo file in the static/images/ directory
2. WHEN choosing logo format THEN the system SHALL use SVG format for scalability and crisp display at all sizes
3. WHEN sizing the logo THEN the system SHALL maintain aspect ratio and ensure readability across all screen sizes
4. WHEN the logo is loaded THEN the system SHALL implement proper fallback handling for loading states
5. WHEN optimizing performance THEN the system SHALL ensure the logo file size is optimized for web delivery

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user experiencing the enhanced hero section, I want the overall visual experience to remain professional and cohesive, so that the improvements enhance rather than disrupt the existing design.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN enhancements are applied THEN the system SHALL maintain the existing color scheme and professional aesthetic
2. WHEN animations are updated THEN the system SHALL preserve the glass morphism and backdrop blur effects
3. WHEN logo is displayed THEN the system SHALL ensure it complements the existing typography and layout
4. WHEN particle effects are enhanced THEN the system SHALL maintain performance standards and avoid visual clutter
5. WHEN all changes are implemented THEN the system SHALL provide a cohesive, premium user experience that builds trust
